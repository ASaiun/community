# Istio Steering Committee

The Istio Steering Committee was formed to oversee the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, branding, and marketing. Steering was created to allow the Techincal Oversight Committee to exclusively focus on the technical aspects of the project. 

## Steering Committee Charter

1. Define, evolve, and defend the vision, values, mission, and scope of the project - to establish and maintain the soul of Istio
2. Charter and refine policy for community groups (including Working Groups and Committees)
3. Define and evolve project governance structures and policies, including how contributors become committers/maintainers, approvers, reviewers, members, code of conduct, etc.
4. Control access to, establish processes regarding, and provide a final escalation path for any Istio repository
5. Control and delegate access to and establish processes regarding other project resources/assets, including artifact repositories, build and test infrastructure, web sites and their domains, blogs, social-media accounts, etc.
6. Manage the Istio brand to decide which things can be called “Istio” and how that mark can be used in relation to other efforts or vendors.
7. Resolve any dispute from the Technical Oversight Committee.

## General Questions

*Why Are Seats Company Held?*

Steering was created as the Istio project was in infancy, in order to tackle governance and overall project strategy. To date Istio 1.0 has the bulk of contributions coming from the project founders, Google & IBM. Together it was decided that having strong corporate leadership was needed for the project to ensure continued velocity. Steering was created with 9 seats held, and with 11 being planned.

*Will Steering Always Be Just IBM & Google?*

That is not the intent. The plan is to add additional seats to Steering. We have not yet decided how that will be done. Your feedback is appreciated. We do want to ensure that those contributing to the project are properly represented. At a minimum, the membership is reviewed once a year.

*Why Does Google Have The Most Seats?*

This is weighted to reflect the bulk of project contributions.

*What Happens If Someone Leaves the Company They Represent?*

In that case, the company will select another represenative to hold the seat. This has happened twice to date. Dan Berg filled a seat vacated by Shriram Rajagopalan, and Dan Ciruli filled a seat vacated by Varun Talwar. 

*What Happens If Someone Leaves the Project or Decides to Leave Steering?*

The same applies; the company will select another represenative to hold the seat. 

*Is It This Way Forever?*

We recognize that governance of an open source project is a living document, and evolves as the community and project grows. This is the model that works for the project now. As it matures, and as the community grows, we expect that needs will change. 

*How Are Things Decided By Steering?*

We currently decide by general consensous. 

## Meetings

The Istio Steering Committee meets weekly; currently on Tuesday mornings. 

Given the nature of the discussions in Steering, meetings are not currently open to the public. Questions around governance are listed as issues in the community repo, and we invite your feedback there.
